There is no other alternative.  Pastor Hagee says that the family living inside of your house is either spirit-filled or controlled by the system based upon the choices made each and every day.  We are vessels of the Holy Spirit, and God literally lives in us if we are children of the Most High God.  As Christians, we choose to walk in the light while others fumble around in darkness.  We have a higher calling.</p>  <p>A parent must choose to follow the path that God has chosen for their children, to guide and direct them towards a prosperous future through Jesus Christ.  We are people of covenant and should behave differently than those living in the world.  The Bible says that we are to train up a child in the way he should go so that when he is older he will not depart from the Word of God hidden in his heart.  God is faithful to finish the good things He starts in the life of your children, but as a parent you must plant the seed and lead by example.</p>",

There is no other alternative.  Pastor Hagee says that the family living inside of your house is either spirit-filled or controlled by the system based upon the choices made each and every day.  We are vessels of the Holy Spirit, and God literally lives in us if we are children of the Most High God.  As Christians, we choose to walk in the light while others fumble around in darkness.  We have a higher calling.</p>  <p>A parent must choose to follow the path that God has chosen for their children, to guide and direct them towards a prosperous future through Jesus Christ.  We are people of covenant and should behave differently than those living in the world.  The Bible says that we are to train up a child in the way he should go so that when he is older he will not depart from the Word of God hidden in his heart.  God is faithful to finish the good things He starts in the life of your children, but as a parent you must plant the seed and lead by example.</p>",

The Old Testament is a covenant. The New Testament is a covenant. \r\n\r\nGod made covenant with Noah by placing a rainbow in the sky Promising that he would not destroy the world again by flood. That rainbow still appears today. God made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that the land of Israel would be theirs forever. That covenant still stands. \r\n\r\nGod made a covenant with David that his seed, specifically Jesus Christ, would reign on His throne forever in the City of Jerusalem. God will keep his covenant and Jesus will come and reign over all the earth from Jerusalem. \r\n\r\nEvery feature of the Bible is bound together by covenant. Throughout history, God has never done anything of importance without making a covenant. This series explores the life-changing covenants of God. It will truly revolutionize your life. \r\n\r\n",

Pastor Hagee explains how we will either conquer fear or fear will conquer us.  Like any emotion, fear can be a good thing.  The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.  Learning how to bridle our fear is key.</p>  <p>In life we do many things because we fear painful consequences.  But just like we are told to raise up a child in the way he should go, God disciplines us as well.  God planted the emotion of fear in our moral nature to make us uneasy with our sin.  If we fear an eternity spent in hell, we are sure to look to a Savior who can redeem us.  It is not a matter of if you will bow, only a matter of when.</p>",

There is not one thing about mankind that causes Him to favor one individual over another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While He is not a respecter of persons, He is a respecter of principle.  He establishes His principles through His Word and has promised that His Word will not return void.  Since God does not change and keeps His promises for thousands of generations, Pastor Matthew Hagee shares with you that great hope in knowing that the same God is still sitting on His throne and watching over you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is time to break free from the bondage that binds you and put your faith in your Redeemer and become a soldier for Christ!</p>\r\n ",
